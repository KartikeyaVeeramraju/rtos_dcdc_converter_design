UART Health Check Stream total time of execution is 191 us


However, the processor was found to settle at a much lower frequency of sampling when both the
interrupts were activated. This leads to a re adjustment of the ADC1 and 
ADC2's sampling rates. However, their execution tmes are expected to be the same.

ADC1			42.32 us	19.03 us		25.6 - 31.6 us		44.9%

Conclusions based on utilization:
---------------------------------
- Total utilization is 85.3% which is less than 100% which indicates that the following set of tasks are schedulable by 


UART Interrput Details:
As UART is not a periodic job, it is not possible to classify as a periodic job. However, it could be classified as one by considering it operation as
a continuous data stream which reads the health data every period. And that way we can classify it as a priodic job.


Notes from meeting with Dr.Z
----------------------------
1. If UART is failing, check utilization of all tasks and see if it sums up to greater than one
2. URM threshold may not work but try time demand analysis with arbitary priority order
3. Check the periods and execution times of each tasks and note those values down and then perform the time demand analysis


What am I including in ADC1:
Execution time is the time for execution time of the entire controller IIR filter and buffer update


What am I including in ADC2:
Execution time is the time for execution time of the entire controller IIR filter and buffer update
